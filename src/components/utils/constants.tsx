					Fair Use
				</h2>
				<p className=''>
					Jolly Podcast offers unlimited use to many features, and aims to offer
					a great user experience throughout. We strive to offer a simple and
					transparent pricing system as a part of this. We don&apos;t charge
					extra costs when Jolly Podcast is used reasonably and normally. Your
					usage is all included within the base price. We do, though, need to
					make sure that our services work fairly for everyone and with the best
					possible user experience. This means a great quality of service to
					every user, in a fair and distributed way.
				</p>
				<p className=''>
					To ensure that every user can access Jolly Podcast in an optimal way,
					we monitor technical usage and jobs done according to our Fair Use
					Policy. This policy has been put together to avoid improper use of
					Jolly Podcast&apos;s tools, so that we can offer all our customers an
					excellent user experience.
				</p>
				<p className=''>
					We monitor recording tool usage, and ask that users respect these
					limits. If you&apos;re regularly exceeding these limits, we&apos;ll
					get in touch to discuss our options. This may involve an extra cost to
					your service with Jolly Podcast.
				</p>
			</div>
			{/* Audio Processing */}
			<div className='space-y-2'>
				<h2 className='text-lg lg:text-xl font-bold my-2 underline'>
					Audio Processing
				</h2>
				<p className=''>
					When you upload a recording, or create a recording directly in the
					app, Jolly Podcast does audio clean-up processing work on that file.
					This uses up server processing power. In normal usage we have plenty
					of resources to account for this, but we have monthly upper limits to
					ensure that any single user cannot use up an unfair proportion of
					server resources and disadvantage other users. The limits are as
					above, in the call recording example.
				</p>
				<p className=''>
					Daily shows, and weekly shows, would be expected to upload up to 10
					hours per month, at an upper extreme. If you regularly go above this
					limit, we&apos;ll get in touch to discuss options. This may involve an
					extra cost to your service with Jolly Podcast.
				</p>
				<p className=''>
					In reality, the majority of weekly shows run 40 minutes to 1 hour, at
					most, so an average weekly show would tend to use 4 to 5 hours of
					uploads per month.
				</p>
				<p className=''>
					We monitor upload levels, and ask that users respect these limits. If
					you&apos;re regularly exceeding these limits, we&apos;ll get in touch
					to discuss our options.
